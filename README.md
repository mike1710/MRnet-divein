# MRnet-divein
My final project at the Technion data science certification studies
The data and baseline model implementation were taken from Stanford University’s ‘MRnet’ competition.
Train and validation datasets are available online at this link"

Diagnosis of knee injuries is time consuming and expensive.
It is believed that automated solutions can free some time for doctors to examine patients with more severe and complex conditions.
Convolutional neural nets demonstrate outstanding accuracy scores on vision problems. For some tasks such as classification – better than humans.

The article proposes to diagnose common knee injuries using CNN state of the art architectures.
This study’s goal is to test the hypothesis that neural nets can be an approach good enough to classify simple Knee MRI tasks.
